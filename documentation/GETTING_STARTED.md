## 4. Initial Setup Checklist

After creating your repository from the template, complete the following steps:

- [ ] **Update `README.md`** — Replace the template name, description, badges, and author section with your project's details.
- [ ] **Update `LICENSE`** — Change the copyright year and author name.
- [ ] **Create a `solutions/` folder** — Add your Power Platform solution source, or rename/delete this folder if not using Power Platform.
- [ ] **Add `.gitignore`** — Add language/framework-specific ignore rules for your project.
- [ ] **Configure branch protection** — See [Step 7](#7-branching-strategy) for recommended rules.
- [ ] **Add GitHub Secrets** — See [Step 5](#5-configure-github-secrets).
- [ ] **Enable GitHub Discussions** — Recommended for community Q&A (referenced in `config.yml`).
- [ ] **Update `documentation/GETTING_STARTED.md`** — Refine this file to reflect your project's specific setup.

---

## 5. Configure GitHub Secrets

The CI/CD workflows authenticate to Power Platform via a service principal. Add the following secrets to your repository:

**Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret**

| Secret Name | Description | Example Value |
|---|---|---|
| `POWERPLATFORM_ENVIRONMENT_URL` | Default Power Platform environment URL | `https://orgabc123.crm.dynamics.com` |
| `POWERPLATFORM_APP_ID` | Azure App Registration (client) ID | `xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx` |
| `POWERPLATFORM_CLIENT_SECRET` | Azure App Registration client secret value | `abc123~...` |
| `POWERPLATFORM_TENANT_ID` | Azure AD / Entra ID tenant ID | `xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx` |

> **Security tip:** Rotate client secrets regularly and use the minimum required permissions. Never hardcode secrets in workflow files or source code.

---

## 6. Power Platform Integration

This template ships with two GitHub Actions workflows that automate ALM (Application Lifecycle Management) for Power Platform solutions.

### 6.1 Register an Azure App (Service Principal)

The workflows use a service principal to authenticate to Power Platform without requiring interactive login.

1. Go to [portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com) → **Microsoft Entra ID** → **App registrations** → **New registration**.
2. Name: `github-powerplatform-spn` (or similar).
3. Select **Accounts in this organizational directory only**.
4. Click **Register**.
5. Copy the **Application (client) ID** and **Directory (tenant) ID** — you'll need these for GitHub Secrets.
6. Go to **Certificates & secrets** → **New client secret**.
7. Set an expiry, click **Add**, and immediately copy the **secret value**.

### 6.2 Grant the App Access to Power Platform

1. Go to [admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com).
2. Navigate to **Settings** → **Application users** → **New app user**.
3. Click **Add an app**, search for the app registration you created, and select it.
4. Choose your target **Business unit**.
5. Assign the **System Administrator** security role (or a custom role with solution import rights).
6. Click **Create**.

Repeat this for every environment you intend to deploy to.

### 6.3 Export a Solution (Power Platform → GitHub)

Use this workflow when you've made changes in a Power Platform environment and want to commit them to source control.

**When to use:**
- After customizing a solution in the maker portal
- To capture a baseline snapshot of an environment
- Before merging changes from another developer's branch

**How to run:**

1. Go to your repository on GitHub → **Actions** tab.
2. Select **"Power Platform to GitHub"** from the left sidebar.
3. Click **"Run workflow"**.
4. Fill in the inputs:

| Input | Description |
|---|---|
| `solution_name` | Exact API name of the solution in Power Platform (e.g. `ContosoCore`) |
| `source_environment` | Full environment URL (leave blank to use the `POWERPLATFORM_ENVIRONMENT_URL` secret) |
| `solution_type` | `Unmanaged` (recommended for source control), `Managed`, or `Both` |

5. Click **"Run workflow"**.

**What happens:**
- The workflow exports the `.zip` from Power Platform.
- It unpacks the solution into `solutions/<SolutionName>/` as individual XML/JSON files.
- A Pull Request is opened automatically on a branch named `export/<SolutionName>`.
- Review the PR diff and merge to `main` to commit the changes.

### 6.4 Deploy a Solution (GitHub → Power Platform)

Use this workflow to deploy the current solution source in `main` to a Power Platform environment.

**When to use:**
- Promoting changes from `main` to a dev, test, or production environment
- Deploying after a PR merge
- Setting up a new environment from source

**How to run:**

1. Go to **Actions** → **"GitHub to Power Platform"**.
2. Click **"Run workflow"**.
3. Fill in the inputs:

| Input | Description |
|---|---|
| `solution_name` | Name of the solution folder under `solutions/` (e.g. `ContosoCore`) |
| `target_environment` | Full environment URL to deploy to |

4. Click **"Run workflow"**.

**What happens:**
- The workflow packs the solution source from `solutions/<SolutionName>/` into a `.zip`.
- The packed artifact is uploaded under the **Actions** run for audit purposes.
- The solution is imported into the target environment with overwrite and publish enabled.

## 7. Branching Strategy

This template follows a **trunk-based development** model:

```
main ──────────────────────────────────────────► (production)
  │
  ├── feature/add-canvas-app ──► PR ──► merge ──► main
  │
  ├── fix/duplicate-record-bug ──► PR ──► merge ──► main
  │
  └── export/ContosoCore ──► (auto-created by workflow) ──► PR ──► merge ──► main
```

| Branch pattern | Purpose | Lifetime |
|---|---|---|
| `main` | Production-ready, protected | Permanent |
| `feature/<description>` | New features | Until merged |
| `fix/<description>` | Bug fixes | Until merged |
| `hotfix/<description>` | Critical production patches | Until merged |
| `release/<version>` | Release candidate preparation | Until tagged |
| `export/<solution-name>` | Auto-created by export workflow | Until merged |

### Recommended Branch Protection for `main`

**Settings → Branches → Add branch protection rule** → Branch name pattern: `main`

- [x] Require a pull request before merging
- [x] Require at least 1 approving review
- [x] Dismiss stale pull request approvals when new commits are pushed
- [x] Require status checks to pass before merging
- [x] Require conversation resolution before merging
- [x] Do not allow bypassing the above settings

---

## 8. Commit Message Convention

This template follows [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).

### Format

```
<type>(<optional scope>): <short description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

### Types

| Type | When to use |
|---|---|
| `feat` | A new feature |
| `fix` | A bug fix |
| `docs` | Documentation changes only |
| `style` | Formatting, missing semi-colons, no logic change |
| `refactor` | Code restructuring without feature or fix |
| `test` | Adding or updating tests |
| `chore` | Build process, dependency updates, tooling |
| `perf` | Performance improvements |
| `ci` | CI/CD configuration changes |
| `revert` | Reverts a previous commit |

### Examples

```bash
feat(solutions): add ContosoCore solution scaffold
fix(workflow): correct solution pack path in github-to-powerplatform
docs(getting-started): add Power Platform setup section
chore(deps): update powerplatform-actions to v1.3
ci(export): set solution type to Unmanaged by default
```

## 9. Working with Issue Templates

Three issue templates are pre-configured in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`:

| Template | Label | Use when |
|---|---|---|
| **Bug Report** | `bug` | Something is broken or behaving unexpectedly |
| **Feature Request** | `enhancement` | Proposing a new feature or improvement |
| **Question / Support** | `question` | Asking for help or clarification |

Blank issues are disabled by default. Users are directed to GitHub Discussions for general questions.

To **add a new template**, create a new `.md` file in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` following the existing format, or convert to YAML-based forms for structured input (see [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/configuring-issue-templates-for-your-repository)).

## 10. Customization Reference

Quick reference for the most common customizations after forking this template:

| What | Where | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Project name & description | `README.md` | Update title, badges, overview section |
| Author info | `README.md` (bottom) | Name, blog, LinkedIn, GitHub |
| License year/author | `LICENSE` | Find & replace the year and name |
| Default solution name | `.github/workflows/*.yml` → `default:` | Change `'MySolution'` to your solution API name |
| Default environment URL | `POWERPLATFORM_ENVIRONMENT_URL` secret | Set in repo Settings → Secrets |
| Branch protection rules | GitHub Settings → Branches | See [Section 7](#7-branching-strategy) |
| Issue template labels | `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/*.md` → `labels:` | Must match existing repo labels |
| Discussions URL in config | `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/config.yml` | Update org/repo name in the URL |
| Add new workflows | `.github/workflows/` | Use `workflow_dispatch` for manual triggers |

---

## 11. Troubleshooting

### Workflow fails with "unauthorized" or 401 error

- Verify all four secrets (`POWERPLATFORM_APP_ID`, `POWERPLATFORM_CLIENT_SECRET`, `POWERPLATFORM_TENANT_ID`, `POWERPLATFORM_ENVIRONMENT_URL`) are correctly set in **Settings → Secrets**.
- Confirm the app registration exists in the same tenant as the Power Platform environment.
- Ensure the application user has been created in the target environment (see [Section 6.2](#62-grant-the-app-access-to-power-platform)).
- Check that the client secret has not expired.

### Solution pack step fails — "folder not found"

- Confirm the solution folder exists at `solutions/<SolutionName>/` in the `main` branch.
- Check that the `solution_name` input matches the folder name exactly (case-sensitive).

### Export workflow creates a PR but files are empty / unchanged

- The solution may not have any customizations since the last export.
- Verify the correct `source_environment` URL is used.
- Check that the solution name in the input matches the **API name** (not the display name) in Power Platform.

### `create-pull-request` step is skipped

- GitHub Actions must have **read and write permissions** to create branches and PRs.  
  Go to **Settings → Actions → General → Workflow permissions** → select **Read and write permissions**.

### `pac` CLI commands fail locally

```bash
# Authenticate to Power Platform
pac auth create --url https://YOUR_ORG.crm.dynamics.com

# List available solutions
pac solution list

# Export a solution manually
pac solution export --name MySolution --path ./out/exported --managed false
```
